To create an embedded C program that interfaces a servo motor and an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) with a microcontroller, we will assume the following:

Servo Motor is controlled by PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) measures distance by emitting ultrasonic pulses and measuring the time it takes for the echo to return.
Hardware Requirements:
Servo Motor: Connected to a PWM capable pin of the microcontroller (e.g., Pin 9 on an Arduino).
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: Connected to the microcontroller's digital I/O pins (e.g., Trigger pin on Pin 2 and Echo pin on Pin 3).
In this example, I'll use an Arduino environment to demonstrate the code since Arduino has a simple and widely used development environment for embedded systems. If you're using another platform, you can adapt the code to your specific microcontroller.

Step-by-Step:
Servo Control: The servo motor is controlled via a PWM signal, where the width of the pulse determines the angle of the servo.
Ultrasonic Sensor: The HC-SR04 has two pins: Trigger and Echo. The Trigger pin is used to send a pulse, and the Echo pin gives the time taken for the signal to return, from which we can calculate the distance.
Arduino Code Example:
c
Copy code
#include <Servo.h>

// Pin definitions for the ultrasonic sensor
#define TRIG_PIN 2
#define ECHO_PIN 3

// Pin definition for the servo motor
#define SERVO_PIN 9

// Create a Servo object
Servo myServo;

// Function to measure distance from the ultrasonic sensor
long measureDistance() {
  // Send a pulse to the trigger pin to start the measurement
  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW);  // Ensure it's LOW initially
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, HIGH); // Send a 10us pulse to trigger
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW);
  
  // Measure the pulse duration on the Echo pin
  long duration = pulseIn(ECHO_PIN, HIGH);
  
  // Calculate the distance in cm (speed of sound is approximately 343m/s, so 1cm = 58us)
  long distance = duration / 58; 
  
  return distance;
}

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication for debugging
  Serial.begin(9600);
  
  // Initialize the ultrasonic sensor pins
  pinMode(TRIG_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ECHO_PIN, INPUT);
  
  // Initialize the servo motor
  myServo.attach(SERVO_PIN);
  
  // Set the servo to a default position (0 degrees)
  myServo.write(0); // Servo position 0 degrees
  delay(1000); // Give time for the servo to reach the position
}

void loop() {
  // Measure the distance using the ultrasonic sensor
  long distance = measureDistance();
  
  // Print the distance to the serial monitor for debugging
  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");
  
  // Move the servo based on the distance (for example, map the distance to an angle)
  int angle = map(distance, 0, 200, 0, 180); // Map distance (0-200 cm) to servo angle (0-180 degrees)
  
  // Move the servo to the new angle
  myServo.write(angle);
  
  // Wait before measuring again
  delay(500);
}
Explanation:
Servo Motor:

The Servo.h library is used to control the servo motor. The myServo.attach(SERVO_PIN) function attaches the servo control to the specified pin.
The myServo.write(angle) function sets the position of the servo, where angle can range from 0 to 180 degrees.
Ultrasonic Sensor:

The Trigger pin is used to send a 10-microsecond pulse to initiate the ultrasonic burst.
The Echo pin listens for the return of the pulse and measures the duration of the pulse using pulseIn(). The distance is then calculated based on the duration.
Mapping the Distance:

We map the distance (0-200 cm) to a range of 0-180 degrees for the servo, allowing it to rotate proportionally to the distance measured.
Serial Communication:

The Serial.begin(9600) and Serial.print() functions are used to output the distance data to the serial monitor for debugging purposes.
Testing the System:
Upload the code to an Arduino.
Open the serial monitor to see the distance measurements.
The servo motor will adjust its position based on the distance detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
Adjustments:
Distance Range: You can adjust the map() function to change the behavior, like using a larger or smaller range for distance or servo angle.
Pin Configuration: Modify the TRIG_PIN, ECHO_PIN, and SERVO_PIN to fit your specific hardware setup.
This should give you a basic embedded system that uses a servo motor and an ultrasonic sensor. Let me know if you need any additional modifications!
